Any function can produe a side effect such as:
- printing a text on the screen
- influence the state of an object
- modifing a file

Now, the side effects are considered a bad thing, which is true, but they are also why we programm, to change a file or to display somenthing, **tho, we do not code for changing the state of an object**, so if possible is good norm to leave the state alone, such as with [[Pure Functions]].
