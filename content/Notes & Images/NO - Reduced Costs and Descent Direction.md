##### Summary:
The **reduced cost** is given by:
$$
\left(c_N^t - c_B^t \kern2px B^{-1} \kern2px N \right)x_N
$$
Where:
- $x_N$ is a vector and it's equal to $\vec 0$ only if we have that $x$ is a **vertex**

We define the **descent direction** as a direction given by $x_N$ such that if we increase it the **reduced cost** decreases.

If we cannot find a new descent direction, then we are in a **local optima**, also if we have that the problem is **convex** we know that it's the **global optima**
