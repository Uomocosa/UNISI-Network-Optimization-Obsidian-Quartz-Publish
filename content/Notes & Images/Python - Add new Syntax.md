# IMPORTANT
To add a new syntax to python you would need to
- Never directly call the files with new syntax (and pass them through a tokenize function)
-- OR --
- Change the entire python syntax (which is better but it can cause all kinds of problems)

-> So it's best to not change it, tho it is unfortunate.
