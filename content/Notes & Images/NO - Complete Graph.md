### Definition:
In the [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") field of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Graph theory"), a **complete graph** is a [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_graph "Simple graph") [undirected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undirected_graph "Undirected graph") in which every pair of distinct [vertices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory) "Vertex (graph theory)") is connected by a unique [edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(graph_theory) "Edge (graph theory)"). A **complete digraph** is a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph "Directed graph") in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a pair of unique edges (one in each direction).
