A more complex, but resource-efficient method is the **pivot operation**:
==Select a **non-basic variable** inside $x_{\tiny N}$ with a **negative** value and bring it in the **basic variables** ($x_{\tiny B}$)==
As a result one of the basic variable will turn to $0$ and exit the **base** or the problem is **unbounded**.
