It should be a decorator

It should be used only in class-functions

Assure us that every calls to the same class-function has the same state

A Singleton class function as every class-function is considered pure only if the state is immutable, for example the setattr is set to `pass`, tho, a pure class-function is really useless, its better to use a normal function
