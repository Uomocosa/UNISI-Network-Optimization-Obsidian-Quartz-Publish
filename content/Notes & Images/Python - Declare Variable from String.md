Python give us the possibility of declaring a variable using a string as the variable name, such as:

```python
locals()['local_variable'] = "DIOCANE"
globals()['global_variable'] = "DIO Ãˆ MORTO"
```

Each variable has its scope as **local** or **global**, depending which function used to delcare it.
