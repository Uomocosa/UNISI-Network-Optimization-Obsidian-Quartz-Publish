From the Sublime Official Documentation there are two very usefull links that might go unnoticed, those are.
- The [API Envoirments](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/api_environments.html): 
	- "Plugins in Sublime Text are Python files located in the root of a [package](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/packages.html). The following document describes the Python environment the plugins are run in."

- And the [API Reference](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/api_reference.html)
	- Where we can find all the description of the varius classes and methods of the "***sublime***" and "***sublime_plugin***" (python) packages
