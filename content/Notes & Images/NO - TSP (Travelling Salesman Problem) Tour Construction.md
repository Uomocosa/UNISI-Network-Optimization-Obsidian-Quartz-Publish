For the **starting point** we usually take a **random city**.

While for the **selection criterion** we have seen:
- [[NO - TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) Arbitrary Insertion|Arbitrary Insertion (Random City)]]
- [[NO - TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) Nearest Neighbour|Nearest Neighbour]]

For the **insertion criterion** we have seen:
- [[NO - TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) Nearest Addition]]
- [[NO - TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) Farthest Addition]]
- [[NO - TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem) Nearest Merge]]

Also we have seen the [[NO - Christofides's algorithm|Christofides's algorithm]], which creates a tour for the *TSP* (Travelling Salesman Problem), solving first a *MST* (Minimum Spanning Tree) problem.
