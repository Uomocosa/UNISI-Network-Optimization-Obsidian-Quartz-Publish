> **NOTE**:
> The professor in the slides defined the result of a **Relaxation** as a **LB** (Lower Bound), this is true as long as the original problem is a **minimization problem**, the **feasible solution space** of a relaxation is bigger than that of the original problem, so there is more solution to choose from and in the minimization problem we can find a better solution which will be **LOWER** than the optimal solution of the original problem.
