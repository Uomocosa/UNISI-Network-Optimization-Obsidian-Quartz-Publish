In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **functional programming** is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm") where programs are constructed by [applying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_application "Function application") and [composing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science) "Function composition (computer science)") [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_science) "Function (computer science)"). It is a [declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming") paradigm in which function definitions are [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure) "Tree (data structure)") of [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science) "Expression (computer science)") that map [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science) "Value (computer science)") to other values, rather than a sequence of [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming") [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science) "Statement (computer science)") which update the [running state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science) "State (computer science)") of the program.

In functional programming, functions are treated as [first-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen "First-class citizen"), meaning that they can be bound to names (including local [identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_(computer_languages) "Identifier (computer languages)")), passed as [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming) "Parameter (computer programming)"), and [returned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value "Return value") from other functions, just as any other [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type "Data type") can. This allows programs to be written in a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming") and [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability "Composability") style, where small functions are combined in a [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming "Modular programming") manner.
